# Adjusting Entries

## Current Status

Adjusting-entry workflows are not currently implemented in the user-facing UI/API.

Not yet available:

- Create adjusting-entry form workflow
- Submit/cancel/reset actions before submission
- Manager approval/rejection workflow
- Adjusting-entry status list and filtering
- Posting integration to ledger/statements from UI workflow
- Manager notification on adjusting-entry submission

## What Exists Today

- Database tables exist (`adjustment_metadata`, `adjustment_lines`).
- Database audit triggers include adjustment tables.

## Documentation Note

This section should be expanded once adjusting-entry pages and APIs are implemented.
